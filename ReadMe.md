### README: Music Tokenization Workflow Using K3 Labs

#### Overview

This project integrates **K3 Labs** functionality to bridge off-chain music streaming data with on-chain token economics. Using data from streaming platforms for an artist like [Shine Dark](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/shine-dark/993072837), we calculate a token's value based on music performance metrics and facilitate royalty management through blockchain mechanisms.

---

### Features

1. **Streaming Data Integration**

   - **Goal**: Leverage K3 Labs' data functions to import music streaming data for Shine Dark.
   - **Purpose**: Analyze streams to calculate token valuation metrics based on artist popularity and revenue generation.

2. **Token Valuation**

   - **Formula**: A custom profile is created that tracks streaming metrics, computes revenue projections, and determines token valuation in real-time.

3. **Royalties Management**

   - **Wallet Alerts**: Use K3 Labs' wallet alert system to notify when royalties are deposited.
   - **Fiat-to-Crypto Swap**: Integrate Uniswap to convert fiat royalties into a project token automatically.

4. **Staking via EigenLayer**

   - **Security Mechanism**: Stake project tokens via EigenLayer to enhance network security and incentivize token holders.

5. **Automation Workflows**
   - Create K3 workflows to:
     - Fetch streaming data (e.g., API integration with Apple Music or similar platforms).
     - Trigger token value updates.
     - Automate royalty-to-token conversions.

---

### Implementation Steps

1. **Data Retrieval**

   - Use K3 Labs’ **API Query Functions** to fetch Shine Dark's streaming data, including play count, listeners, and geographical performance.

2. **Tokenization Formula**

   - Create a weighted scoring system:
     - Streams (50%)
     - Listener engagement (30%)
     - Regional impact (20%)

3. **Wallet Integration**

   - Set up a K3-compatible wallet to receive royalties.
   - Configure alerts to notify royalty deposits.

4. **Fiat Conversion**

   - Connect the wallet to **Uniswap** using K3’s integration modules.
   - Automate fiat-to-token swaps with pre-defined triggers.

5. **Staking Infrastructure**
   - Utilize **EigenLayer** to allow staking of tokens by investors or fans, securing the network and providing additional rewards.

### Example Workflow

**For Shine Dark’s Streaming Activity**:

1. **Streams**: 1,000,000 plays in a month.
2. **Royalties**: \$4,000 received.
3. **Token Value**: Updated using the formula.
4. **Conversion**: \$4,000 converted into tokens and distributed to stakeholders.
5. **Staking**: Tokens are staked via EigenLayer for added security.

### Requirements

- **K3 Labs Account**
- **Streaming API Access** (Apple Music, Spotify, etc.)
- **Blockchain Wallet**
- **Uniswap and EigenLayer Configuration**

---

### Future Enhancements

- Expand integration with multiple streaming platforms.
- Add NFT-based rewards for top token holders.
- Enable community voting using staked tokens for artist-specific projects.
